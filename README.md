## Abstract

Link Traversal queries face challenges in completeness and long execution time due to the size of the web.
Reachability criteria define completeness by restricting the links followed by engines. However, the number of
links to dereference remains the bottleneck of the approach. Web environments often have structures exploitable
by query engines to prune irrelevant sources. Current criteria rely on using information from the query definition
and predefined predicate. However, it is difficult to use them to traverse environments where logical expressions
indicate the location of resources. We propose to use a rule-based reachability criterion that captures logical
statements expressed in hypermedia descriptions within linked data documents to prune irrelevant sources. In
this poster paper, we show how the Comunica link traversal engine is modified to take hints from a hypermedia
control vocabulary, to prune irrelevant sources. Our preliminary findings show that by using this strategy, the
query engine can significantly reduce the number of HTTP requests and the query execution time without
sacrificing the completeness of results. Our work shows that the investigation of hypermedia controls in link
pruning of traversal queries is a worthy effort for optimizing web queries of unindexed decentralized databases.


## Building a PDF
The authors compiled the PDF version using `pdflatex` (you can use your favorite latex compiler).
We created a `makefile` to facilitate the building of the PDF version.
One can simply execute `make main.pdf` or `make` to produce the PDF version if `pdflatex` and the other dependencies of the [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) suite are installed on the machine of the user.
A PDF version is also available in the [github releases sections](https://github.com/constraintAutomaton/rule-based-approach-for-source-selection-in-LTQP/releases/).

## Conclusion

This paper reported on preliminary tests to add guided link traversal support into the Comunica
querying engine using a rule-based reachability approach. A similar approach could be performed
with other SPARQL query engines supporting Link Traversal Query Processing. Our preliminary
results show that our rule-based reachability criterion can significantly reduce the execution time of
queries aligned with hypermedia description constraints compared to predicate-based reachability
opening the possibility for faster and more versatile traversal-based query execution over fragmented
RDF documents. Our experiment also highlights that the size of the internal data store might have
more impact on performance than noted in previous studies. In future work, we will perform more
exhaustive evaluations of other types of domain-oriented fragmentation strategies such as string and
geospatial evaluations, and investigate how to generalize our approach to support more expressive
online reasoning for online source selection during traversal queries. Furthermore, we also showed
there might still be room for optimization by researching ways for pruning useless triples from the
internal triple store during the link traversal process.
